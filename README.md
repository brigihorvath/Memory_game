# Memory Game Project

A Udacity Front-End Developer Scholarship Project - 2018

The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched. 
When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. 
It should also tell the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
